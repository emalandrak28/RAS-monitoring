Comprehensive Description: RAS (Recirculating Aquaculture System) Monitor

This Python script implements a robust, multi-sensor monitoring and alerting system designed for a Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS). It runs on a Raspberry Pi and continuously tracks critical water quality and equipment parameters, publishing the data to a cloud dashboard (ThingsBoard) and triggering instant mobile alerts if any values fall outside safe operating ranges.

 1. Core Purpose and Functionality

The primary purpose of this system is to automate the monitoring of a sensitive aquatic environment. It performs the following key functions in a continuous loop:
-   Data Acquisition: Reads from multiple analog and digital sensors.
-   Data Processing: Applies statistical filtering to reduce noise and outliers.
-   Data Logging: Saves all readings with timestamps to a local CSV file and creates a backup.
-   Data Transmission: Publishes each sensor's data to its respective device on a ThingsBoard IoT platform via MQTT.
-   Alerting: Evaluates readings against predefined thresholds and sends immediate push notifications to a phone via Pushover if any parameter is out of bounds.
-   Robustness: Includes comprehensive error handling and logging to ensure long-term, unattended operation.

 2. Key Components and Technologies

-   Hardware Platform: Raspberry Pi.
-   Sensors:
    -   DS18B20: A digital temperature sensor for water temperature.
    -   ADS1115: A 16-bit ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) used to read multiple analog sensors with high precision.
    -   pH Probe: Connected to the ADS1115. Voltage is converted to pH value.
    -   Conductivity Probe: Connected to the ADS1115. Voltage is converted to conductivity value.
    -   Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04 likely): Used for non-contact water level measurement in a sump or tank. GPIO pins trigger and read the echo.
    -   Current Sensors (e.g., ACS712): Two sensors connected to the ADS1115 to measure the current draw (and infer operation) of the recirculating and dispensing pumps.
-   Software/Protocols:
    -   MQTT: A lightweight messaging protocol for IoT. Used to send data to ThingsBoard.
    -   ThingsBoard: An open-source IoT platform for data visualization, storage, and device management.
    -   Pushover: A service for sending real-time push notifications to mobile devices.
    -   Logging Module: For detailed, timestamped status updates and error tracking.

 3. Architectural Overview: The `SensorMonitor` Class

The entire system is encapsulated within the `SensorMonitor` class, promoting organization and reusability.

-   Initialization (`__init__`):
    -   Sets up GPIO pins for the ultrasonic sensor.
    -   Initializes the I2C bus and the ADS1115 ADC.
    -   Creates and connects a separate MQTT client for -each- sensor to ThingsBoard using unique device credentials. This allows for independent data streams and dashboards.
    -   Initializes a data cache dictionary (`sensor_data`) to hold the latest readings.
    -   Sets up a timer for the main execution loop.

-   Advanced Sampling Method (`get_filtered_sample`):
    This is a critical function that ensures data quality.
    -   It takes a specified number of samples (`SAMPLE_COUNT`).
    -   It sorts the samples and discards a specified number of highest and lowest values (`DISCARD_COUNT`), effectively removing outliers.
    -   It returns the average of the remaining, stable middle values.
    -   This technique significantly reduces noise and erroneous spikes from sensor readings.

-   Sensor Measurement Methods (`measure_-`):
    Each method (e.g., `measure_ph`, `measure_water_level`) defines a function for a single reading and then calls `get_filtered_sample` to get a robust value. The results are stored in the `sensor_data` cache. Each method includes a linear conversion formula to translate voltage into meaningful engineering units (e.g., pH, ÂµS/cm, Liters, RPM).

-   Data Handling Methods:
    -   `publish_data`: Iterates through the `sensor_data` cache and publishes each value as a JSON payload to its dedicated MQTT topic on ThingsBoard.
    -   `log_data`: Appends all current sensor data with a timestamp to a CSV file (`water_temp2.csv`) and immediately copies it to a backup location (presumably a mounted USB drive).
    -   `check_alerts`: Compares the latest readings against the hardcoded `ALERT_THRESHOLDS`. If any threshold is breached, it compiles a list of alerts and sends them via `send_pushover_notification`.

-   Control Loop (`collect_and_publish`, `run`, `stop`):
    -   `run()` starts the system and initiates the main loop.
    -   `collect_and_publish()` is the heartbeat of the application. It is called periodically (every `PUBLISH_INTERVAL` seconds) by a `Timer` object. It executes the full cycle: measure all sensors -> publish -> log -> check alerts -> schedule the next run.
    -   `stop()` and `cleanup()` provide a graceful way to halt the system, cancel the timer, disconnect MQTT clients, and release GPIO resources.

 4. Workflow and Process Flow

1.  Start: The script is executed. The `SensorMonitor` object is created, initializing all hardware and MQTT connections.
2.  Loop Begins: The `collect_and_publish` method is called.
3.  Data Collection: Each sensor is read multiple times, and a filtered average is computed.
4.  Data Transmission: The filtered data is published to ThingsBoard and logged to the CSV file.
5.  Alert Check: Values are checked against thresholds. Alerts are sent immediately if needed.
6.  Wait: The method schedules itself to run again after a 10-minute (`PUBLISH_INTERVAL`) sleep.
7.  Termination: If a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) or error occurs, the loop is stopped, and resources are cleaned up gracefully.

 5. Configuration and Constants

The script is highly configurable through constants defined at the top:
-   Cloud Settings: ThingsBoard host, topic, and device access tokens.
-   Alerting Settings: Pushover API keys and user key.
-   Timing: Interval between readings (`PUBLISH_INTERVAL`).
-   Data Quality: Number of samples to take and discard (`SAMPLE_COUNT`, `DISCARD_COUNT`).
-   Safety Thresholds: All operational thresholds (`ALERT_THRESHOLDS`) for temperature, pH, water level, and pump current are defined here for easy adjustment.

 6. Error Handling and Logging

The script is designed for reliability:
-   Try-Except Blocks: Nearly all operations are wrapped in try-except blocks to prevent a single sensor failure from crashing the entire system.
-   Comprehensive Logging: The `logging` module is configured to output messages to both the console and a log file (`ras_monitor.log`). This is essential for debugging issues in a headless production environment.

 7. Conclusion

This code represents a complete, professional-grade IoT solution for environmental monitoring. It effectively bridges the physical world (sensors) with the digital cloud (ThingsBoard) and provides a critical safety net with its instant alerting system. Its modular class-based design, focus on data integrity through filtering, and extensive error handling make it a robust application suitable for a 24/7 operational context like aquaculture.
